    <h2>Troubleshooting Yahoo Mail Login Issues</h2>
    <p>
      If you're having trouble logging in, click on “Forgot password?” to reset it. Yahoo also provides account recovery through alternate email or mobile verification. Double-check your browser and make sure cookies are enabled for smoother access.
    </p>

    <h2>Enable Two-Step Verification for Security</h2>
    <p>
      To add an extra layer of protection, enable two-step verification from your account settings. This ensures that even if someone has your password, they still need your mobile phone to log in.
    </p>

    <h2>Use the Yahoo Mail App</h2>
    <p>
      Download the official Yahoo Mail app from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. It's a fast and secure way to check your emails, especially on the go.
